# My ASU College Schedule Conversion
 This program takes the HTML data from the schedule page of My ASU and automates the conversion of the schedule information to a free online schedule visualizer for student ease of use

The Conversion is made for https://gizmoa.com/college-schedule-maker/

This program is extremely simple to use:
1. Download the HTML data from your My ASU Schedule page by Right Clicking on the page in your browser and selecting "Save As". Make sure to save the html file in the same directory as this project or change the FILE_PATH constant to match the file path of the downloaded HTML
2. Run the program, a file called "ASU Class Schedule.csmo" should be created in the same directory as the main.py script
3. Go to https://gizmoa.com/college-schedule-maker/ and select the import button on the left hand side of the page
4. Drag and drop the "ASU Class Schedule.csmo" into the popup box on https://gizmoa.com/college-schedule-maker/ and select yes

That's it! Enjoy the now easily readable class schedule, because we all know the My ASU schedule visualizer sucks!


This project was made with the aid of Microsoft Copilot, if you have not used Copilot before I definitely reccomend giving it a try as it is an extremely powerful AI tool and can help with lots of things.
